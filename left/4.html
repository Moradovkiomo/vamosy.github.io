        <h1>Friendly Fire</h1>

        <p>Left 4 Dead 2 is one of the few games where friendly fire is always on. The damage done to other players depends on the difficulty, but it's generally bad etiquette to shoot teammates anyway. On higher difficulties, it's absolutely crucial that players watch their aim. For example, on Expert difficulty, weapons will do 50 percent of their full damage towards a teammate.</p>
