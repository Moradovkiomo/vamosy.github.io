        <h1>Shove Is Your Best Friend</h1>

        <p>As a Survivor, the "shove" mechanic is of the utmost importance for both your team's survivability and your own. By pressing right-click, the player will perform a quick swing that pushes back common infected and gives the player some breathing room. This move is unbelievably useful when the team is getting swarmed by hordes of infected. However, be aware that this shove move can not be used indefinitely. After a couple shoves, the Survivor will get "fatigued" and will need a brief cooldown before shoving again.</p>


        <p>The shove can also be applied towards certain Special Infected. For example, if a player witnesses a fellow teammate being assaulted by a hunter, smoker or jockey, one shove will separate the two unwilling parties. From there, it's a simple matter of filling the opposing party full of lead. You should also use the shove against the Boomer before shooting it, as killing it at too close of a range will cause its contents to splatter all over you, attracting more infected. Thus, shoving it to a safe distance and then killing it ensures less mess.</p>

        

        <p>As an added tip, players with decent enough reflexes can shove a pouncing Hunter or Jockey mid-flight. To do this, shove slightly upwards while facing the airborne force. A successful shove will send the Hunter or Jockey reeling backwards, setting up for an easy extermination.</p>
