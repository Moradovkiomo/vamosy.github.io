        <p>This will not be the first time this will be said, but I have reasons for repeating it.</p>


        <p>Don’t vacuum the map. “Director” sends out waves exactly when you are least ready for it. One hit of an ordinary infected on a Survivor on an expert takes 10/20 HP, and this, as you know, can be fatal for the whole team.</p>


        <p>The faster you go, the less you getting waves. The gaps between them are short, and the problems that these waves sometimes make players to restart the chapter. Don’t vacuum the map.</p>
