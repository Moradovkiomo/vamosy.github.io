        <p>It's inevitable that players are going to get hit over the course of Left 4 Dead 2. Getting hit depletes the HP gauge on the bottom of the screen, and the color changes based on how much damage has been taken. Upon reaching less than 39 health, the Survivor will begin to noticeably limp. This will decrease their speed significantly, which can hinder progress. Reaching zero health will incapacitate a player, and they'll need a fellow player to help them back on their feet.</p>


        <p>However, getting back up will not restore hit points and leave the player even slower than before. Using a health pack is the optimal choice, but that can often take too long. Consider using pain pills or adrenaline shot to temporarily stave off the damage</p>


        <p>As a side note, being incapacitated twice without healing will put the player into greyscale vision, which indicates that the next incapacitation will kill the player.</p>
