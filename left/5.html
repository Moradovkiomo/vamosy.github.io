        <p>Throughout the campaign, players will sometimes come across an item called "Adrenaline shot." To new players, it just seems like less effective pain pills, but that's not the case. In addition to providing some temporary health, it has other benefits.</p>


        <p>The most noticeable effect is that the player will no longer be slowed by the clawing and kicking of the Infected. Players can literally just run through an entire crowd without even slowing down a second. This is especially useful when players are at the end of a campaign and trying to reach the rescue vehicle. The other benefit to the shot is the increased speed bonus towards actions, such as reloading, healing, reviving and others, which are all halved by it.</p>
