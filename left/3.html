        <h1>Burn the Tank</h1>

        <p>Tanks are the pseudo-bosses of Left 4 Dead 2, and facing one unprepared can lead to a failed campaign. Thankfully, the Tank is not invincible and has some glaring weaknesses to take advantage of. First, the Tank is extremely susceptible to fire. Even the Tank's massive health pool will quickly drain when set alight, so that should be your first priority when fighting one. The easiest way to do this is by throwing a Molotov or shooting it with incendiary ammo. Crafty players can also shoot nearby gas cans to achieve the same effect.</p>


        <p>Another tip to keep in mind is that the Tank has a 15 percent damage reduction towards shotguns (since pellets don't have much effect against tough hides). As such, it's best for Survivors to use assault rifles against Tanks, since the high velocity rounds will pierce right through it. Additionally, players won't have to get within breathing distance of a Tank to do consistent damage.</p>


        <p>As an added note, the Tank will sometimes throw chunks of concrete or cars at the player. This can be easily avoided by getting behind cover or moving out of the trajectory of the throw. Bolder players can attempt to destroy the projectile mid-air, but that requires some finesse to pull off.</p>
