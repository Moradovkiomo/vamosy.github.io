        <p>As with many games that run on Source, crouching will significantly improve gun accuracy. While this may seem like a negligible tip, especially considering it's hard to miss a horde of gibbering zombies, it is useful in certain situations. For instance, if there's a teammate being choked out by a rooftop Smoker, it would be wiser to headshot the Smoker first rather than run up and shove the teammate.</p>
