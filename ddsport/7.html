        <head>Point DD Sports</head>

        <p>Here is the tricky part. The points collected are only valid if you complete the rounds or you stick around till the end of the match.</p>


        <p>The tie-ups with other apps allow Hostar app  to give away many prizes.</p>


        <p>The points earned during the match work as an app currency and can be used for micro transactions to buy cash backs and discounts.</p>


        <p>Needless to say, there is a 1st, 2nd, 3rd prize but the DD Sports app ensures that each participant gets something and comes back to try their luck again.</p>


        <p>The prizes are only available for live events</p>
