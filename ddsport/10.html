        <p>News DD Sports</p>


        <p>The news tab in the app is very interesting. It provides the option of viewing the news channels live, mostly the channels which are already free to air. It also plays the top headlines on queue as soon as you land on the news tab home. Although, various news outlets are available in multiple languages.</p>


        <p>The top suggested are the ones from your own country and in the native language by default. But differs if the settings have been customized.</p>


        <p>The network also has an in house news outlet. It is interesting because there is no prominent news channel in the star network, only entertainment, and sports.</p>
