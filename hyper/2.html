        <h1>Adding shows to your list:</h1>


        <p>Once you've got yourself set up, you'll want to find all the shows you need to catch up on - a bit of Freaks and Geeks, anyone? One of Hyper's most useful features is the 'My List' section, which can hold 500 titles. Simply tap the 'plus' sign on each show you want to see or save for later.</p>

        <p>Smarter than your average list, it will reorder itself if a new series of a show comes out, if a title is set to expire, or if a friend has watched the same show (provided you've connected your account to Facebook).</p>
