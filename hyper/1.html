        <h1>Protect the little 'uns:</h1>


        <p>Of course, among Hyper's content there's stuff that's a little unsavoury for younger viewers. While you're setting up profiles, you'll see a section that says 'Allowed TV shows and movies' where you can choose between four levels of maturity (from 'little kids" to 'all').</p>

        <p>If that's not enough control for you, you can also set up a PIN under the 'Parental controls' part in Settings.</p>
