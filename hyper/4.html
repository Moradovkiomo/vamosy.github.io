        <h1>Turn off autoplay:</h1>


        <p>We all enjoy binge-watching, but sometimes you don't want Hyper to actively encourage it - and that means turning off its autoplay feature. To do this, go to 'Your Account > Playback Settings', then uncheck the 'Play next episode automatically' option.</p>
