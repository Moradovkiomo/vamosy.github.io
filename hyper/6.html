        <h1>Limiting your data use:</h1>


        <p>If you watch a lot of Hyper on your smartphone or tablet while you're out and about, you can change how much data is used at any time - ranging from around four hours per GB to an unlimited plan.</p>

        <p>To do that, head to the 'App Settings' section of your smartphone's Netflix app, then 'Mobile Data Usage'. For similar management on your laptop, you can use Hyper's 'HDToggle' option by going to 'Account > Playback' settings.</p>
