        <h1>Skip introductions:</h1>


        <p>When you are on a binge session, you don't want to sit through a lengthy opening title sequence every single time. So let's skip them.</p>

        <p>n the bottom-right corner of the screen, there's a nice 'Skip Intro' button that will whisk you straight into the plot. But use with caution - it can sometimes brush past any plot that happens before the title sequence.</p>
