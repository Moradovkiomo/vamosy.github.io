        <h1>Rating shows:</h1>


        <p>Rather than having a five-star system like other apps (such as Apple Music), Hyper has gone for a more binary approach. You can rate a show or movie with either a thumbs-up or a thumbs-down, and Hyper will suggest more (or less) similar content to you accordingly.</p>
