        <p>First of all, we understand the difference between auto headshot and headshot in the free fire. If the bullet fired by us hits the enemyâ€™s head, it is called headshot in the language of gaming. Now it is not easy to kill the enemy with headshot because the enemy keeps on movement, so it is difficult to hit his head, so many players use an auto headshot or free fire headshot hack, which helps them improve their In-game aiming skill.</p>
