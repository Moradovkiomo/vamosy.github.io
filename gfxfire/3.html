        <h1>IS THERE AN APP FOR PROFESSIONAL HEADSHOTS?</h1>


        <p>Option 1 - Use a professional headshot app to remove the backdrop. There are some free apps that allow you to manually cut out the background, and they use artificial intelligence technology to make it easier and faster.</p>


        <p>Focos: This is an amazing app for Android or iPhone that blurs out the ackdrop behind you a LOT.</p>
