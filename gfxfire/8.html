        <h1>WHAT IS A GFX?</h1>


        <p>well, In simple terms, GFX stands for 'Graphics'. Graphics is a very vauge term. While yes it can means how good something looks, it can also means, baisically, an art piece.</p>


        <p>So yes, a GFX can be a rendered image, or it can mean a 2D image but overall, It's just an art thing.</p>
