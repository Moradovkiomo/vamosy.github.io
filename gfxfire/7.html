        <h1>WILL I GET BANNED FOR USING GFX TOOL IN BGMI?</h1>


        <p>The Rules of Conduction clearly states that the use of GFX tools is illegal in the eyes of the developers.</p>


        <p>Gamers will be handed over a permanent ban if they are found out using third-party GFX tools...</p>


        <p>However, gamers should refrain from implementing these applications on their devices to keep their accounts protected.</p>
