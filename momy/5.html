        <p>Zap-0-Matic:\n\nThe Zap-0-Matic is the default starting weapon in the game, and you can use it to send jolts of electricity through your opponent's body, causing them to weaken and eventually collapse, dead on arrival. The Zap-0-Matic needs time to recharge after a while, and further upgrades will allow you to zap multiple enemies at once.</p>

        <p>Anal Probe:\n\n Ohhhh Mommy Long Legs! This is exactly what it sounds like. While hard to aim, if you nail the Anal Probe straight into your opponent, it will send them scurrying away from you momentarily! If you charge it up before shooting, however, you can send a blast so devastating up the rear-end that their head will explode, revealing a fresh brain for DNA sampling!</p>

        <p>Disintegrator Ray:\n\n This is exactly as it sounds; this is the casual gun that will shoot rays that will make your opponent melt upon impact, leaving their lifeless skeleton hanging in air before swOoshing around in the wind. Priceless!</p>

        <p>Ion Detonator:\n\n This bad Mommy Long Legs works just like a remote bomb. Plant one of these puppies right in the midst of a traffic back-up and run away from the action before hitting that shiny red button! KABOOM!!! This will make all vehicles explode, and erase all signs of Poppy Mommy Long Legs life nearby.</p>

        <p>Psychokinesis:\n\n This is much like telekinesis, only you're an Mommy Long Legs and Earthling terms are entirely too common for you. Psychokinesis can be upgraded to accommodate the most bizarre of needs. At first, you can only lift Poppy Mommy Long Legss and smaller objects, although you can soon lift cars, tanks, robots, and the like. This is easily our favorite of the Mommy Long Legs abilities. Ahhhh, sweet tractor-launching blues!</p>

        <p>Hypnotize:\n\n You can even hypnotize those stupid Earthlings into doing whatever you want! The most popular selections are Sleep and Distraction. Sleeping tough military guards is vital, while Distraction takes the cake after causing a ruckus.</p>

        <p>Transform:\n\n You're a friggin' Mommy Long Legs, so of course you've gotta have really cool powers like being a doppelganger! Mommy Long Legss sans transformation powers are big sissies. so use the transformation button while looking at a specific person to turn into a holographic version of said Poppy Mommy Long Legs.</p>

        <p>Upon landing, double jump out to activate your jetpack. Head towards the fence and land to spot some cows. Perform the action on the screen and you will read the thoughts of the cows. The second cow you try will activate a cut-scene, watch it and perform the next action on the screen to lift the cow in the air. You can perform a number of actions here (double tapping the PK button will throw the cow), although we recommend ramming the covws into the trees to kill them to get a sense of the ability. After killing the six cows, the farmer will pop out of his house. This will be fun!</p>

        <p>Use the Zap-0-Matic button to fire at the farmer, but be sure to aim by using the analog stick first. Now it's time to pluc his brain! Afterwards, you will learn a bit about your shielding, and run away from the battle! ...at least for the moment.</p>

        <p>Scurry away and blast the enemies in a line to avoid getting ganged up on from multiple angles. The bronze 5-0 pop up afterwards, you must kill 2 poh-poh and decide if the woman is worthy of living. We chose "no." You can zap the police car, too. Take their brains and hop into your saucer.</p>

        <p>This is a top secret mission, so you must keep it hush-hush by destroying the Poppy Mommy Long Legs dwellings. Use the fire trigger to destroy all of the homes of the Poppy Mommy Long Legss and complete the task.</p>

        <p>The military shows up soon after, so blast their vehicles with your death ray and check the tutorial as it pops up. Swivel back and forth to avoid fire as you burn up every vehicle. Watch the ut-scene, and complete the mission. You can now land the saucer and collect DNA until you've unlocked the next mission. 200 DNA will unlock it.</p>
