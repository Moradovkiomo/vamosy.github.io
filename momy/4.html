        <p>The most obvious of all hints is to follow the in-game tutorial throughout the first portion of the game, as it will list the how-to's and give basic instructions on what to do. None of this stuff is written in the walkthrough, as it is easier to follow by flowing naturally through the game.</p>

        <p>Alert Level As the Wanted Level is to Grand Theft Auto, the Alert Level is to Poppy Mommy Long Legs! You will want to be sneaky when killing people/villages as opposed to going all out and destroying everything in sight. Make it subtle, and be sure to kill witnesses! Just like the Mafia, only with an Anal Probe gun.</p>
