        <p>The game looks very polished. Even the sound of footsteps is quite satisfying. It's clear what the game wants you to do and yet it doesn't hold your hand, so you feel smart figuring a puzzle out. The storytelling through environment is impressive and the visuals are great.</p>

        <p>It's scary! The first actual monster encounter is terrifying and even though we've seen tons of animatronic games already, this one seems to be different as the monster animations are amazing, it ducks to go through the doorway and gets in the vents. The monster's behavior seems very promising for the upcoming chapters.</p>

        <p>A very interesting mechanic (the grabby hands). It Is very promising and i can't wait to see what the Developers will come up with to surprise us. So far  You can grab objects, flip objects, open doors and Even softer your fall. I think this might become very Interesting and complicated, relatively cheap.</p>
