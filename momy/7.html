        <p>Get ready, as you will have to travel through highly dangerous areas in order to eliminate each target.</p>

        <p>Remember to keep your eyes peeled when looking for your targets, as you may take unnecessary damage otherwise. You can use your new toy to take down the motel itself, while using the Death Ray to damage the turrets and missile launchers far down below.</p>

        <p>This completes the mission once you've destroyed everything, so head back to the Mothership and take off for Back down at Santa Modesta, you will need to take up the role of assassinating Bert Whither, a famous newscaster that the people look up to. You will need to followa crackpot around and scan his thoughts whenever they purple thought cloud appears above his head.</p>

        <p>Continue doing this until you reach the cook. Hypnotize the chef and watch out for the machines that give away your identity! PK them aside before you get there, and follow the chef closely. You will have to destroy the red-blinking machines in order to down the powered gates. Go in and watch the cut-scene with Bert Whither.</p>
