        <p>We are playing as an ex-employee of a toy factory who has to return there to save his previous co workers after receiving a message that they might be still alive and trapped somewhere in the factory. But the factory is full of animatronics who wants to hug you till you pop. The game will take you less than 1 hour to beat as only 1 chapter is released so far.</p>
        
        <p>Right off the bat the game presents some interesting and original mechanics - you get to use your grabpack (that looks like 2 huge hands that you can shoot anywhere) to grab objects, flip them, open the doors and even soften your fall. It plays an important role in solving puzzles and is very promising for future chapters.</p>
