        <p>See? It's not so bad. Police do not account for the 12, so ignore them and head straight for the normal Poppy Mommy Long Legss walking (or running) down the street. You have one minute and thirty seconds to complete this task.</p>

        <p>Armageddon! features you attempting to destroy everything in sight. You will have three minutes even to destroy every building in sight... well, nine of them anyway.</p>

        <p>Just look for the nine that are lit up with the purple icons and blow them to pieces. Lastly, there's Rockwell BB0, where you must quickly dispose of six cows in thirty seconds. It's big to lift them up with the PK and drop them fiercely to the ground for the easy (and quick) kill.</p>
