        <p>Any light in a room that's not created by the projector is going to reduce image quality. Even if you have a fancy light-rejecting screen, ambient light is bad and you're going to want to do everything you can to reduce it.</p>

        <p>The biggest culprit is the sun. If you're planning on watching TV during the day, you're going to need to cut down the light in the room. Even if your projector does OK during the day when you buy it, the lamp is only going to get dimmer over time. In a few years, you're going to need to buy curtains to see anything, so you might as well get them now. If your spouse doesn't like the look of blackout curtains, any heavy curtains or shades will help. If you're watching a lot of content during the day, a projector might not be the best primary option anyway. So for those occasional mid-day movie marathons, sporting events, etc, anything that cuts down the glare should work.</p>

        <p>The next step isn't as big of a deal, but in a dark room all those little LED power lights suddenly become the Beacons of Gondor. Some electrical tape works wonders. </p>
        
        <p>Even expensive projectors leak light somewhere other than where you want it. With inexpensive projectors, this is often a squarish halo of light spilled around the screen. There's not much you can easily do about it, and it's quite common. It's why most theaters have the area around the screen painted black.</p>
