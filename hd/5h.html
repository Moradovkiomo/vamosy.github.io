        <p>Every projector is going to have slightly different settings but there are a few that are fairly universal. Like TVs most have picture mode settings like Sports, Movies or Vivid. Usually the one called something like Movie, Cinema or Theater will deliver the best, most accurate picture.</p>

        <p>Projectors have most of the same picture settings that TVs do, so it's worth reviewing how to set those too.</p>

        <p>The most important settings specific to projectors have to do with the lamp. Inside most projectors is some kind of super-bright light bulb, called a lamp. A handful of projectors use LEDs or lasers , but these are less common for home theater projectors.</p>
        
        <p>Remember the adage "a candle that burns twice as bright burns half as long"? Well that, basically, with your projector's lamp. While the projector might look its best on its brightest lamp setting, it's not going to last as long as it would in a dimmer setting. Most current projectors are rated to last 4-5,000 hours on their normal lamp setting, which is several years if you're watching 4 hours a day. If the price of a lamp replacement, usually over $100, doesn't seem like a big deal, go ahead and run it full bore. Why not?</p>

        <p>If you have a smaller screen, only watch at night, or want to save some money in the long run, you can dial back the brightness. Often this is called Eco mode, but the change will be very noticeable regardless what it's called on your projector. Dimmer lamp modes are usually quieter as well, as the fans don't have to work as hard.</p>

        <p>There's also commonly a dynamic brightness mode that runs the lamp at 100% during bright scenes, and then makes it dimmer during darker scenes. Usually this mode offers even longer lamp life, but this ramping up and down of the light might be visible. With some projectors the fans getting faster and slower is noticeable as well.</p>

        <p>Some projectors have an automatic iris. This works similarly to the dynamic brightness mode, but the lamp doesn't change. Instead, a mechanical iris dims the image during dark scenes. How well these work varies greatly. Some people don't mind them, others find it annoying. There isn't as much of a payoff, however, like the longer lamp life of the dynamic brightness lamp mode.</p>
