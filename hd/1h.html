        <p>The vast majority of inexpensive projectors lack a feature known as lens shift. This means they need to have very specific placement relative to the screen, often in line with the top or bottom of the screen. Sometimes the throw angle is even greater, meaning it needs to be below, or above, the edge of the screen.</p>


        <p>This is counter-intuitive, as you might assume you need to place the projector in line with the center of the screen. This is almost never the case with inexpensive DLP projectors, and usually not the case with inexpensive LCD projectors either. Higher-end LCOS projectors, like those from Sony and JVC, typically have lens shift that allows for a greater range of vertical placement options.</p>
        

        <p>Next is the distance from the screen. Most projectors, other than the short-throw variety, can usually fit a 100-inch screen from a distance of about 10-feet. This can vary, though, and it's important to verify before you start drilling holes in your ceiling. The zoom range with most projectors is also fairly limited, meaning you'll only have a few feet of "sweet spot" to fill a specific-sized screen. This info is almost always on the manufacturer's website for your projector, or in the owner's manual.</p>
