        <p>Most projectors have manual focus adjustments, either using a wheel attached to the lens, or motorized. Once in a while you'll find one that has autofocus. There are pros and cons to each of the main types, and how best to achieve the sharpest focus possible.</p>

        <p>With both options, I find it best to use a bright image, or the bright part of an image. Barring that, you can bring up the user menu, and use that. These will typically have bright lettering on a dark background, which should help.</p>

        <p>With a motorized focus, stand up at the screen and slowly adjust until you can see the individual pixels. It's possible they'll be too small to see, depending on the size of your screen, the resolution of the projector, and your eyesight. You should be able to make out the darker outlines, however. Adjust the best you can, but ideally each pixel will be obvious when you're standing at the screen. Sometimes, even with high-end projectors, the adjustments will be too coarse to get perfect. Don't stress about it. As long as you're close it should look fine when you're seated. If your projector is on a stand, you could experiment with nudging it backward a fraction of an inch, if the focus is in between one of its steps.</p>
        
        <p>With analog, manual adjustments, you're actually more likely to get perfect focus as there are typically no "steps" to the adjustments, just a smooth analog rotation of the focus wheel. I've reviewed a few projectors that have focus wheels that stick, or don't move smoothly. The technical term for this is "annoying." The main issue with this type of focusing method is that you're standing at the projector, and the screen is on the other side of the room. If you can't make out the pixels at all from where you're standing, enlisting a hapless, well-sighted aide will work. I believe this is the main reason people have children.</p>
