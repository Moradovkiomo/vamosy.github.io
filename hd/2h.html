        <p>A crucial consideration that ties in with placement is adequate airflow. Projectors are basically space heaters. They throw out a seemingly equal amount of heat and light. If the airflow isn't adequate, the projector could overheat and shut down, you could significantly reduce the life of the lamp, and theoretically start a fire. The latter isn't too likely, but this isn't something to take for granted.</p>


        <p>Professional installers build fan-vented cabinets for projectors. If you're not sure how to do this yourself, perhaps don't risk it and leave the projector in the open.</p>


        <p>The other side of this is if you're planning on putting the projector behind your sofa, chances are there's going to be at least one "hot seat," with the main fan belching hot air at someone's head. In the winter this could be quite cozy. In the summer, not so much. Different projectors have different fan designs, so it's hard to say the best way to handle this. Most of the projectors I've reviewed for CNET recently have fans on the front and sides. Most of these you can see in the pictures.</p>
