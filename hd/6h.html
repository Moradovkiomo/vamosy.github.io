        <p>Don't expect to use the speaker built into the projector. It's like buying a Porsche and putting on tires from a wheelbarrow. The sound just won't match the grand picture.</p>

        <p>The cheapest alternative is getting a decent speaker, and connecting via an analog cable. Some projectors have Bluetooth, as do Roku and Amazon Fire ($30 at Amazon) Sticks which you can connect to directly, but Bluetooth has a lag that manifests as a lip-sync error. Not ideal for long-term use. Go analog if you can.</p>

        <p>Better would be a soundbar or receiver with speakers. Connect these all with HDMI for a real home theater experience.</p>
