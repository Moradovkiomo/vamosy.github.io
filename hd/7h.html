        <p>Now that you've got everything set up and running, there are a few "best practices" to keep in mind with a projector that are different from a TV. They all center around the lamp.</p>

        <p>A traditional UHP projector lamp is a fragile thing. Electricity sparks across two electrodes. This creates the light you see. Over time, the electrodes degrade, sort of like how a candle's wick burns away. Eventually, they'll be too far apart for the arc to form, and the lamp is dead. No picture for you.</p>

        <p>The biggest shock to these poor little electrodes actually occurs when you first turn on the projector. Leaving it running, on the other hand, isn't as punishing.</p>

        <p>In another counter-intuitive aspect of projector ownership, it's better leaving it on instead of turning it on and off multiple times in a row. There's no hard rule, but multiple restarts in a single night is bad for lamp life. Leaving it on might be better. For what it's worth, since I use my projector as the main "TV" in my home, it runs for many hours every night. I routinely get many, many more hours out of a lamp than what it's rated.</p>

        <p>How strict you want to be with this is up to you because, as I said, there's no hard rule. I'd generally say if the projector is still warm when you want to use it again, you shouldn't have turned it off in the first place. Turn it off when you're done, of course. Don't sweat it if you accidentally turn it off and then want to watch one more episode. If you're doing that every night, that's not great. Just something to keep in mind, and the minds of anyone else who uses the projector.</p>

        <p>Also, never ever unplug a projector when it's on, or even when it's off and cooling down. Most projectors will run their fans for a few minutes to gently cool down the lamp. Pulling the plug doesn't allow this gentle cooldown and is also bad for the lamp.</p>
