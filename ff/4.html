        <head>Play The FF</head>

        <p>Gameplay in Garena Free Fire is not one of the easiest, especially given the mobile devices handling, so it is worth to read the tips below carefully, as they facilitate the entry into the game world:</p>

        <p>Always react to the sound - use the sound generated by the moving player to track him. Also pay attention to the mini-map - each enemy shot is associated with his position on the mini-map.</p>

        <p>Control the battlefield all the time-do not let the enemy flank you and try to surprise opponents.</p>

        <p>Remember about the ever-decresing area of the battle - Open the map regularly to make sure you are not out of range anytime soon.</p>

        <p>The landing place on the map is key- it depends on what inventory You will be able to find, as well as potential players you encounter. During the flight, you should monitor the environment for potential opponents and, if necessary, change the landing place.</p>

        <p>Avoid red and orange zones. The first indicate the area that wil be bombarded-staying in the open air inside the red zone will end with your death, so hide inside the building. The orange zone is the viewing radius of the UAV recon drone- if you get inside it, your position will be open to other players.</p>

        <p>Use your inventory properly. If you have a sniper rifle, try to fight at long distances to make the most of your potential. If, in turn, you have a SMG or a shotgun, try to fight at close distances.</p>
