        <head>Where On The Map Will Land</head>

        <p>Choosing the right place to land is a key issue and mostly depends on what you care about in the first minutes of gameplay:</p>

        <p>If you want to quietly earn equipment and prepare for a clash with other players, land in a more secluded place where there will be only a few buildings in the area. Thanks to this, you will reduce your chances of meeting another player already during the first minutes of the clash - at the cost, however, of less equipment to conquer.</p>

        <p>If you are not afraid of collisions with other players and want to experience the action immediately, land in a place with a high density of buildings-for example, in the Hangar, Cape Town or the Catwalk. Thanks to this, you will be able to quickly equip the character with good inventory, but also increase the chances of encountering another player.</p>
