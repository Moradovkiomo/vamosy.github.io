        <head>What To Do In The First Minutes Game?</head>

        <p>The first few minutes of gameplay are key - this is exactly what your main task is to equip with appropriate gear. Find a long gun, best an Assault Rifle and / or a sniper rifle, as well as Medkits,a backpack, a vest and a helmet. This greatly increases your chances of survival and becoming the winner.</p>

        <p>During the first minutes you should limit attacks on other players-unless you are in direct danger. Do not show your position and focus on acquiring inventory. Additionally, if you manage to access the vehicle, it is worth using it to go to the other end of the map-the chance that there is another player is negligible, making all the items there at your disposal.</p>
