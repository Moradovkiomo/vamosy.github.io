        <h1>Stray: How to Find the Secret Lab in Chapter 6</h1>

        <p>Chapter 6 of Stray features multiple puzzles, the first of which requires players to find Doc's secret lab by investigating his old apartment.</p>

        <p>After scaling the Zurk-infested rooftops to install the newly-repaired transceiver for Momo, Stray players will again find themselves back in the slums. Once there, they'll need to meet with Momo in the bar, which will lead to Jacob mentioning that Doc had been working on a weapon to fight the Zurks before he mysteriously disappeared in the events leading up to Stray.</p>


        <p>Though Momo wasn't aware of Doc's weapon, he does recall his old friend mentioning a secret lab a few times and suggests heading over to Doc and Seamus' place in order to check it out. Players will then be able to follow him over there, though will need to explore the apartment by themselves as Momo is far too large to fit through the damaged vent. What follows is the first of two big puzzles in Chapter 6 of Stray.</p>



        <h1>How to Find Doc's Secret Lab in Chapter 6 of Stray</h1>

        <p>Immediately after entering the apartment, players will find Seamus sleeping on the couch. He soon wakes up, however, at which point players should show him Doc's Notebook from Chapter 4 and ask him about the secret lab. Though he appears interested in helping to find it, he doesn't seem to have any useful information, so players should instead hop up onto the desk with the pictures and certificates hanging above it.</p>

        <p>Upon closer inspection, players will notice that they're able to knock the pictures down. Those who've already unlocked the safe in the slums should already be fairly familiar with this process. For those who haven't, though, it's a simple case of pressing the Triangle button when the prompt appears. Although all of the pictures here can be knocked off the wall, players only really need to worry about two of them.</p>

        <p>The first is the picture of the two robots shaking hands to the far right of the desk. Knocking this off will reveal a hidden message, which, when translated by B-12, reads as "Time Will Tell." The second picture that needs to be toppled is the one of the yellow robot on the far left of the desk. Rather than a secret message, this one instead reveals a hidden keypad that requires a four-digit code much like the Digicode panel from the end of Chapter 3.</p>



        <h1>What is the Secret Lab Door Code?</h1>

        <p>In order to find the code for the secret lab the intended way, players will need to make use of the secret message they found a moment or two ago. "Time Will Tell" is of course a reference to the four clocks on the nearby wall, which, from left to right, are set to two, five, one, and one o'clock respectively. Players can therefore deduce that the four-digit code to open the door to Doc's secret lab is 2511 and typing this into the Digicode panel on the wall will cause a secret entrance to appear. Once inside, players should knock down the cardboard box from the shelf to the right of the whiteboard and then show the broken tracker that falls out to Seamus in order to progress the story.</p>
