        <h1>Stray: How To Open The Door To The Outside</h1>

        <p>Stray's final goal is to free the cyborg city and reunite the Cat with its family by opening the door to the Outside.</p>

        <p>Upon escaping prison and taking the subway key from Clementine, the Cat and B-12 are the last hope to open the door to the Outside in Stray. Activating the station by placing the Atomic Battery in Stray will allow the duo to use the train and reach the final destination.</p>


        <p>After a while, players will arrive at a more pristine-looking subway station, full of robots who don’t seem to have a mind of their own. This is no surprise since memory erasing is used as punishment in prison. The Cat needs to find its way to the control room along B-12 to open the door to the Outside.</p>




        <h1>How To Open The Door To The Outside In Stray</h1>

        <p>To open the door to the Outside in Stray, players need to complete three crucial steps to help B-12 hack the system and open the door: opening the Control Room, activating the system, and disabling the security layers.</p>


        <h1>Opening The Control Room In Stray</h1>

        <p>The Control Room is tightly locked. Using B-12 to get through the door’s system reveals that it was designed to be opened by humans. Therefore, the Drone Companion suggests teaming up with the Stray Cat to open the door.</p>


        <p>Approach the box that’s across the closed door of the Control Room and use B-12 to hack it, making it follow the Cat everywhere. Get close to the second control panel, the left side of the door, to position the box underneath it. Interact with the right panel first, then jump on the box, and the Stray Cat will start scratching the left one, thus opening the door.</p>



        <h1>Activate The System In Stray</h1>

        <p>Upon entering the Control Room, the system is down, and all the machines are shut down. The Stray Cat and B-12 approach the main computer, and the Drone Companion asks the feline to turn on all the other computers to access their data.</p>

        <p>Across the main computer are three rows of screens. Players need to jump on each row and walk on the keyboard of each one to turn it on, thus activating the system.</p>



        <h1>Disable The Security Layers In Stray</h1>

        <p>Activating the system leads to three layers of security, making it impossible to open the door to the Outside. B-12 then suggests finding the machines powering up the security, so it can hack the systems, and the Stray Cat can scratch them to malfunction the machines a bit.</p>

        <p>The three machines can be recognized by a yellow locked key on their screen. The first one is found right of the Roof Control Station; scratch the cables and let B-12 hack it.</p>

        <p>The second one is on the right side of the main computer. Climb the machine, destroy the cables and let B-12 do its thing.</p>

        <p>The last machine is on the left side of the main computer. Jump on the black box and remove the plank to destroy the cables, then let the Drone Companion hack the third machine.</p>

        <p>The last step is to pick up B-12 and bring it to the Roof Control Station to shut the alarm down and open the door to the Outside.</p>
