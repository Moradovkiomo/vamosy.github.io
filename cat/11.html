        <h1>Stray: Where To Find The Worker Keys</h1>

        <p>Finding the Worker Key in Stray requires some sneaking skills to get past all the Sentinels blocking the way in Neco Corp.</p>

        <p>The Worker Keys is a side quest in Stray that’s triggered after talking with a distressed Worker in the Neco Corp Factory. Upon finding Clementine, the cyborg will give the Cat a message and tell it to search for a robot wearing a Blazer. Players then need to steal a couple of items to infiltrate Neco Corp.</p>


        <p>The main reason behind sneaking inside the factory in Stray is to steal the Atomic Battery to power up the train in the subway station. Clementine believes it’s everyone's one-way ticket to the Outside.</p>

        <p>After speaking with the Worker in Stray, walk ahead and hide behind the stack of planks before getting detected by the Sentinel.</p>

        <p>Once the machine turns its light to the right, head left and jump on the white blocks, then jump again on the beam that moves forward to land on a platform. Pull the lever to open the gate and get back behind the pile of planks from the right side of the platform.</p>

        <p>Since the gate is open, head left without getting caught and stand behind a stack of boxes, where a Sentinel is watching a robot clean the ground. When the moving garbage cage block the machine’s vision, get out of hiding and move with the cage. Repeat the same steps with the next Sentinel.</p>

        <p>Upon getting past the two machines, leap onto the submerged barrels to the pile of trash and collect the Worker Key from the pizza box. To get back to the Worker, follow the cages’ path to reach another platform.</p>

        <p>Turn left behind the Sentinel and pull the lever to open the closed gate. Immediately hide in the box before the guard on the other side catches the Cat and B-12 in Stray.</p>

        <p>Once it goes to the other side, climb the white box and cross the barrels to reach the door that leads to the Worker. Giving the keys to the worker will see players rewarded with the Neco Badge. On a side note, managing to sneak past all of the Sentinels in the factory and the residence without getting detected unlocks a hidden trophy, "Sneakitty."</p>

        <p>Entering Neco Corp requires finishing a crucial part of the main quest, which is helping Clementine’s associate, Blazer, by stealing some items. Upon entering the factory, head to the closed mini-gate and crawl under it.</p>

        <p>A Sentinel will be going left and right; wait for it to go left, then quickly run in the other direction. In the next area, there are two Sentinels, and one of them is going left and right. Cross the waters using the barrels, then hide behind the stack of boxes.</p>

        <p>Wait for the machine to go right, then quickly spring left and jump on the barrels to the platform behind the second Sentinel. Go through the slightly open door, and the Worker should be standing to the right. Luckily, there are no Stray Memories to collect for B-12 in this part, so players can focus more on not getting caught.</p>
