        <h1>Stray: How To Decode Clementine's Message</h1>

        <p>To reunite with Clementine, Stray players must solve the Mysterious Message the Outsider left in its empty apartment.</p>

        <p>After successfully stealing the Atomic Battery from Neco Corp Factory in Stray, the Cat and B-12 make an escape after deactivating the traps and arrive at Midtown. However, as the duo return to Clementine’s housing complex, a police officer has closed off the street and won’t let anyone through. Additionally, the first and second floors are heavily guarded by multiple Sentinels.</p>


        <p>In this situation, Stray players need to sneak back inside Clementine’s apartment to hand it to the Atomic Battery. Sadly, the Outsider won’t be there, instead, the cyborg left a coded message about the next location.</p>

        <p>The Mysterious Message has four drawn shapes and to decode it, players must find each item on the note in the exact order Clementine drew it to understand it, as the items are hiding a message. The first item is an incense burner in the living room on the round table in the middle. Follow the smoke to find it. The message reads “I’m with”.</p>

        <p>The next item is a gemstone rock which is found above the computer room. To get there, use the Stray Cat to scratch down a cloth stuck in a drawer on the left side of the burner. This will cause the drawer to stick out, creating a way up. Climb the drawers and approach the blue gemstone rock that reads “Blazer”, which is the robot that Stray players stole the Worker Jacket and Helmet for.</p>

        <p>The third item is a traffic cone with legs. Going to the bathroom will reveal a mannequin with a traffic cone on its head, indicating the third message location. It reads “come to”.</p>

        <p>As for the last item on the Mysterious Message, it's a lava lamp. There are multiple lava lamps throughout the apartment. However, the one mentioned in Clementine’s code is found on a shelf in the kitchen. Use the Stray Cat to jump on the counter and then the shelf to find a message that says “Nightclub”.</p>

        <p>After completing all these steps, players can finally read the complete message, “I’m with Blazer, come to Nightclub”.</p>



        <h1>How To Get To The Nightclub In Stray</h1>

        <p>To reach the Nightclub, head out of Clementine’s Stray apartment carefully without alarming the Sentinels guarding the housing complex. Players can get out of the window and then descend to the second floor using the beams by crossing over the balcony’s railings. After that, jump from the outdoor compressor to the first floor.</p>

        <p>Get out of the complex and proceed to the main plaza. From there, head to the left where there’s a purple neon sign outside the Nightclub in Stray. Sadly, the bouncer won’t let the Cat and B-12 enter, so players have to go inside through one of the windows on the upper floor from the back.</p>
