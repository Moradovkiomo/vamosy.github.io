        <h1>Stray: How to Fix the Broken Tracker in Chapter 6</h1>

        <p>After finding the secret lab in the first part of Chapter 6, Stray players are tasked with locating its owner, Doc. Though he hasn't been seen or heard from since his mysterious disappearance, his son Seamus suggests using an old tracker found in one of the nearby boxes in order to try and find him. There's just one problem, though: the tracker in question has been broken for some time.</p>


        <p>As a result, players will need to get the tracker repaired before they'll be able to use it. Unfortunately, this is far from easy, as several key items are required in order to fix the tracker. Inquisitive players may have already stumbled upon one or two of these items while exploring the slums, but most Stray players will likely need to start from scratch.</p>



        <h1>How to Get the Super Spirit Detergent</h1>

        <p>The first item that players will need to get their paws on is the Super Spirit Detergent, which can be found inside the laundromat. Unfortunately, there's no obvious way to get into the building, so players will need to get creative in order to do so. If they head up to the rooftops above the building's porch, they'll find two robots throwing paint cans from one roof to the other.</p>

        <p>Pressing Triangle will allow players to interact with Vapora, after which, pressing Circle to Meow at the right time will lead to her getting distracted and dropping a can of paint down onto the street below. Once this happens, the owner of the laundromat will come outside to clean it up, allowing players to slip inside. There, on a table near the door, they'll find a bottle of Super Spirit Detergent and will be able to pick it up by pressing the Square button.</p>



        <h1>How to Get the Electric Cable</h1>

        <p>Those wondering what they're supposed to do with the Super Spirit Detergent will soon have their answer, as heading over to the marketplace to the right of the big elevator will reveal that it's actually a tradable item. If players inspect the Electric Cable in front of Azooz, he'll offer to swap it for the detergent, which players should agree to by selecting the latter from the "Show Item" sub-menu.</p>



        <h1>How to Get the Poncho</h1>

        <p>Not far from the main entrance to the slums, players can find an elderly robot named Grandma. If they speak with her, she'll offer to knit the adorable little kitty a poncho, though she won't be able to do so without a length of Electric Cable. After trading the Super Spirit Detergent for the Electric Cable at the marketplace, players should give the latter to Grandma in exchange for the promised poncho.</p>



        <h1>How to Fix the Tracker</h1>

        <p>Now that they have the poncho from Grandma, players can finally get the tracker fixed. To do so, they'll need to head over to the nearby Elliot Programming. If players spoke with Elliot earlier while trying to open the safe in the slums they may be able to enter through the window. If not, they'll need to make their way to the front door and scratch at it until somebody opens it for them.</p>

        <p>As always, Elliot is sat upstairs at his computer, though he'll be reluctant to fix the tracker at first because he is too cold. This is where the poncho comes into play. Players should give the poncho to Elliot, after which he'll thank them and offer to fix any broken items they may have. From here, it's a simple case of showing him the broken tracker and then waiting for a moment or two for him to repair it. After he does so, players can return to Seamus and follow him and the tracker to the next area, where he'll hand over the Outsider Badge.</p>
