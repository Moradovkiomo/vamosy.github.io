        <h1>Stray: How to Find All 4 Notebooks in Chapter 4</h1>

        <p>In order to complete Stray's fourth chapter, players will need to get their paws on four notebooks, each of which contains details about the outside.</p>

        <p>Not long after entering the slums for the first time, Stray players will come face to face with the area's red-cloaked protector, Guardian. If they show him or any of the other robots the postcard from the outside that they picked up a little earlier, he'll mention a group of robots called the Outsiders and recommend talking to a robot called Momo in order to find out more about the outside world.</p>


        <p>Momo lives in a tall building near an orange neon sign, which is where players will need to head next if they wish to progress the main story of Stray. After reaching Momo, he'll reveal that his friends are now missing and that he's unable to contact them due to the transceiver that he's working on being faulty. To help him fix it, players will need to track down four notebooks that are scattered throughout the slums.</p>



        <h1>Momo's Notebook (1/4)</h1>

        <p>Momo will give players his notebook after they speak with him, before going on to reveal that he's now done with dreams of the outside world. After analyzing the notebook, Stray's robot companion character B-12 will suggest finding the other three notebooks, each of which is located in a tall building with the Outsiders logo (a white face with a circle for a mouth on a blue background) somewhere nearby.</p>



        <h1>Zbaltazar's Notebook (2/4)</h1>

        <p>After getting Momo's Notebook, players should head back outside and look to their left, where they'll see a tall building with a large blue Outsiders sign on the roof and enclosed metal railings along the side. Upon reaching this roof, players will need to disable the fan by removing the energy cell, which will allow them to drop down into the flat below. There, beneath a pile of boxes near the sofa, they'll be able to find Zbaltazar's Notebook. To get to it, they'll simply need to jump on the boxes and can then escape the flat through the window by pawing at the blind.</p>




        <h1>Doc's Notebook (3/4)</h1>

        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dbz90kpq0/image/upload/v1658860159/5.4_shtreg.jpg" style="width:100%">

        <p>Doc's Notebook can be found inside a locked safe in a flat full of books. To find it, players should head right after leaving Momo's place and look for a small illuminated sign with the Outsiders logo on it off in the distance. For those having trouble finding it, it's near a rooftop with a couch and television on it not too far away from one of Stray's four vending machines. Once inside the flat, they should find Doc's bedroom and then translate the note on the bed, which will reveal that Doc has a safe hidden behind some of the nearby books.</p>

        <p>After B-12 has finished translating the note, players will receive the safe key. They can then head back out into the main part of the flat and into a row of bookshelves with a ladder at the end of it. At ground level, there are a few piles of books that players can knock over by jumping on them, which will allow them to use the key to unlock the safe and get their grubby little paws on Doc's Notebook.</p>



        <h1>Clementine's Notebook (4/4)</h1>

        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dbz90kpq0/image/upload/v1658860159/5.6_rqby4s.jpg" style="width:100%">

        <p>The fourth and final notebook can be found in Clementine's flat, which is more or less directly opposite Momo's place. Players will be able to identify it fairly easily thanks to the large white Outsiders logo that's been painted on the side of the building. After entering the window and squeezing through a gap in the glass-paneled sliding door, players will be able to find Clementine's Notebook on the desk near her computer. While they're here, they should also grab the sheet music from the bookshelf next to the bed.</p>



        <h1>What to Do After Finding All Four Notebooks</h1>

        <p>Once players have found all four of the Outsiders' notebooks, they'll need to return to Momo's flat. After showing the other three notebooks to him, he'll read the note about the flaw with the transceiver's design and proceed to repair it. Unfortunately, however, it's unable to pick up a signal within the confines of the slums, meaning that players will need to head into Zurk territory and Stray's fifth chapter in search of a signal.</p>
