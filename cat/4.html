        <h1>Stray: How To Get To Momo</h1>

        <p>The Stray Cat saved itself from the Zurks and is now in The Slums looking for a cyborg named Momo.</p>

        <p>The story of Stray follows a lost Cat who was separated from its family and fell to the entrance of the Dead City. The Cat’s purpose now is to find a way out of the decaying cyborg city and reunite with its loved ones.</p>


        <p>One of the few crucial steps to leave this city is by finding a robot called Momo, who knows a great deal about the Outside in Stray. With the help of B-12 and the Guardian, players can find Momo's location. However, it appears there is no way to reach Momo as The Slums is a very dark and chaotic area, meaning players need to find another way through the roofs.</p>

        <p>Momo can be found in The Slums living on the higher floor of a building that has an orange sign. After speaking with the Guardian, turn around and descend the stairs. Jump up the pile of crates to the right and then keep climbing up until players reach a roof that has a bicycle.</p>

        <p>Leap to the platform that has a chair, then to the higher roof up ahead. Next, walk to the sleeping robot and jump to the ledge in front of it. Hop onto two outdoor compressors on top of each other, then a smaller one to finally reach a balcony.</p>

        <p>Jump to the small window to see a robot wearing colorful clothing, that’s Momo.</p>




        <h1>How To Trigger Momo’s Location Quest In Stray</h1>

        <p>Upon entering The Slums through the Dead City in Stray, all its citizens will run and try to hide when they see the Cat, mistaking it for a Zurk. After clearing the misunderstanding with the Guardian, show it the Postcard from the inventory to trigger the mission.</p>


        <p>The cyborg will tell players that going to the Outside is a ridiculous dream, and no one ever attempted to leave except for the Outsiders. Unfortunately, all of them never came back and what’s left of the group is Momo, who lives high up in a building with an orange sign.</p>



        <h1>What To Do After Finding Momo In Stray</h1>

        <p>Momo seems down as all its friends went Outside and never returned. The cyborg doesn’t even react when the Cat and B-12 show it the Postcard from the inventory. Instead, Momo becomes even more dejected and refuses to speak about the Outside.</p>


        <p>Here, it’s the players’ job to collect four special notebooks that’ll lift Momo’s spirit and give it the proper motivation. Upon finding all Momo’s Notebooks in Stray, give them to the cyborg, who rejoices and proceeds to use Doc’s note to fix the damaged Transceiver. Now the Cat and B-12 must travel to The Rooftops that are infested with Zurks to install the Transceiver, which allows contact with the other Outsiders.</p>
