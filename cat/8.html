        <h1>Stray: How to Find the Yellow, Red, and Purple Plants in Antvillage</h1>

        <p>In Chapter 9, a robot named Malo will ask players to help track down some colorful vegetation. Here's where to find the yellow, red and purple plants.</p>

        <p>Antvillage is one of the more unusual places that players get to visit in Stray. As its name might suggest, the Chapter 9 location isn't exactly the largest, though it arguably makes up for this with its impressive verticality. Initially, players won't get to do much here due to B-12's sudden identity crisis, though after speaking with Zbaltazar, they'll have a chance to backtrack a little in order to complete a few miscellaneous tasks.</p>


        <p>As well as the "Cat-a-strophe" trophy, which players can get for disrupting the game of mahjong that's being played by two of the village's inhabitants, players can also get themselves a special piece of flair for the protagonist to wear. In order to obtain the Plant Badge, however, Stray players will first need to find yellow, red, and purple plants for a robot named Malo who hangs out near the village's exit. This guide will explain how.</p>



        <h1>Where to Find the Yellow Plant in Antvillage</h1>

        <p>The yellow plant is perhaps the easiest one to find as it's hidden away not too far from where players meet Malo. They'll need to hop into the yellow bucket near the paint cans to drop to the lower level and then onto a pipe to their right that leads away from the bar. The yellow plant is growing along the side of the structure here and can be picked up by pressing the Square button.</p>




        <h1>Where to Find the Red Plant in Antvillage</h1>

        <p>Near the spot where the two robots are playing mahjong, players will find another yellow bucket. This one will take them down to ground level, where they'll need to jump across some barrels to reach an island with two robots foraging for scrap. To collect the red plant, players will simply need to jump onto the wooden box to the right of these robots and then press the Square button.</p>



        <h1>Where to Find the Purple Plant in Antvillage</h1>

        <p>To find the purple plant, players should look for Alexander, a robot dressed in red who's hanging out near a ladder on the level below Zbaltazar. Looking out away from the cylindrical structure, they should see a tree containing purple plants and will be able to hop out onto a nearby branch in order to collect one. After doing so, players can return to Malo and give him all three plants to receive the Plant Badge.</p>
