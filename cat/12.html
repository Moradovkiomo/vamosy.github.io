        <h1>Stray: How to Get the Atomic Battery in the Neco Corp Factory</h1>

        <p>In order to steal the atomic battery during Chapter 10 of Stray, players will need to solve a challenging puzzle involving three glowing floor tiles.</p>

        <p>In Chapter 10 of Stray, Clementine will task players with stealing an atomic battery from the nearby Neco Corp factory in order to provide power to the Midtown subway system. After shoplifting a worker's jacket and helmet for her flamboyant friend Blazer, players will finally get to infiltrate the factory, where they'll need to move stealthily in order to avoid being detected by the many security drones.</p>


        <p>Eventually, players will find themselves in the room containing the atomic battery, though they won't be able to get their hands on it right away due to the high-tech security system. With the help of a few self-moving boxes and the barrel that they used to bypass the nearby laser grid though, Stray players shouldn't have too much trouble solving the factory puzzle.</p>

        <p>As soon as players enter the room, they should notice a large tube in its center. On the ground surrounding this tube are three floor tiles, each of which will cause the tube to move in some way. Unfortunately, these tiles need to be constantly pressed in order to prevent the tube from reverting back to its default position, meaning that players will need to find three different objects that can press all of the tiles at the same time.</p>

        <p>To accomplish this, players should first head over to the box that starts out on the right panel and press the Square button to activate it. Doing so will trigger a follow protocol, so they should lead the box over to the tile on the opposite side of the tube and then press Square again to turn it off. Rather than placing it right in the center, players will want to position it on the edge of the tile so that they can use it to reach the top of the nearby metal fence while standing on it.</p>

        <p>After entering the fenced-off area, players will need to jump onto the lever to open the gate. Next, they should press the Square button and then lead the second box over to the tile on which the first box started. Once it's there, players can press Square again to lock it in position. At this point, the tube in the center of the room should have a gap in it, allowing objects to pass through it.</p>

        <p>With the two boxes in position, players can now return to the metal barrel which they used to enter the room and roll the barrel through the gap in the tube and onto the final tile. Now that all three of the tiles are activated, players can leave the barrel and grab the atomic battery from the fully opened tube. Doing so will trigger the factory's alarm, so players should head through the exit and hop in the yellow bucket to make their escape.</p>
