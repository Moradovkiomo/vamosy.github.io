       <h1>Tempting though it may be to attempt to slip through the giant fan's spinning blades, players should instead drop back down to the level below them. Near a locked door on a strip of old carpet, they'll find a metal bucket that can be picked up by pressing the triangle button. With the bucket now in hand (well, technically, mouth), players can then head back up to the area with the giant fan, being sure not to accidentally press the Triangle button as they climb.

        <h1>Once they're back at the fan, players will need to head to the concrete slope that leads down to it and press the Triangle button to release the bucket. If done correctly, the bucket will slide down the slope and get lodged in the fan, halting its blades so that the adorable little feline can continue onward toward the game's main area, the slums. If not, players can simply pick the bucket back up and drop it a little further down the slope so that it's taken by the incline as intended.

        <h1>How to Stop the Fan in Chapter 4 of Stray
</h1>

        <h1>During Chapter 4 of Stray players will again find their progress halted by the spinning blades of a fan. This one can be found during the section of the game where players are trying to find the four Outsider Notebooks on a rooftop not far from Momo's flat. To stop this one, players simply need to remove the energy cell from the nearby ventilation power supply, which will enable them to safely drop down the nearby shaft and into the flat below.
