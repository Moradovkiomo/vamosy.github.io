        <h1>Stray: How to Turn on the Big Computer in Chapter 3</h1>

        <p>Before they can activate the B-12 companion drone, Stray players will first need to turn on the big computer by finding four hidden energy cells.</p>

        <p>Chapter 3 of Stray takes place almost exclusively inside a small flat. As they explore the seemingly empty residence, players will soon come across a message on a computer screen asking them for help. By walking over the keyboard and being sure to hit its Enter key, it's possible to reply to this message, which, after a few nonsense messages, will eventually lead to the unknown sender unlocking a nearby door to a secret lab.</p>


        <p>Inside the lab, players will find many more computers and monitors, though the ones that they need to interact with in order to progress do not yet have power. Conveniently, there are four energy cells scattered around the room, though finding them all can be a little tricky. With a few well-placed leaps, however, players will be able to turn on the big computer and unlock B-12, who is one of the most charming video game companions in recent memory.</p>

        <p>In order to turn on the big computer in Chapter 3 of Stray, players will need to find the four energy cells that are scattered around the room and plug them into the empty sockets so that the monitors light up. One or two of these cells are out in the open, but the others will only become accessible once players have manipulated the room a little. It doesn't really matter which order players find them, though it perhaps makes sense to grab the one in the terminal before the one on the shelf.</p>


        <p>-Energy Cell 1: Jump on the lever on the right side of the room so that the computer terminal slides over to the left. The energy cell is attached to the bottom of the computer terminal.
        -Energy Cell 2: After moving the computer terminal, climb on top of it and then leap up to the shelf on the left. The energy cell is inside an old computer server.
        -Energy Cell 3: Use the stool on the left side of the room to climb onto the nearby bookshelf. The energy cell is on top of the shelf between the two CCTV cameras.
        -Energy Cell 4: Climb onto the desk in the center of the room. The energy cell is plugged into the electronic equipment on the desk, though players will only be able to reach it from the side that's facing the big computer.</p>



        <h1>How to Unlock B-12</h1>

        <p>After plugging in all four energy cells, the bookcase will slide to the right and reveal another of Stray's secret rooms. Inside, players will find an old robot, which they can climb on in order to get on top of the shelves on the left-hand side of the room. There, they'll find a cardboard box containing a B-12 drone, though they won't be able to open it from here. To get inside the box, they'll need to press the Triangle button to knock it down onto the ground, after which they'll be able to hop down and pick up the drone, again with the Triangle button.</p>

        <p>Now that they have the B-12 unit, players should take it back through to the lab. They'll see that the computer monitors there are no longer showing binary code, with each one now displaying a large arrow instead. These arrows will direct players to an unusual electronic device on the desk near a golden Maneki-neko (beckoning cat) statue. If they head over to this device and press Triangle, the AI that was messaging players early will be uploaded to the drone.</p>
