        <h1>Stray: How To Steal Worker Jacket And Worker Helmet</h1>

        <p>Stealing the worker jacket and helmet is an important step in Clementine’s plan to reach the Outside in Stray.</p>

        <p>Upon finding Clementine’s apartment in Stray, the robot explains that the Cat must search for its associate somewhere in Midtown and sneak inside Neco Corp together to get the Atomic Battery. The only clue is that it’s wearing a bomber jacket and a gold chain. Players will find Clementine’s Contact near the clothing store in Midtown.</p>


        <p>After finding the contact, speak with Blazer and show Clementine’s message to start the plan. The Cat and B-12 need to steal a Worker Jacket and a Worker Helmet in Stray to disguise Blazer and infiltrate Neco Corp Factory.</p>

        <p>From Blazer’s location, head to the clothing store on the left to steal the jacket. However, a robot is watching the shop, so enter the room in the back where there’s a Cassette Player and play the tape from the robot in Clementine’s housing complex.</p>

        <p>This will cause loud music to blast through the entire store, distracting the store owner. Wait for the Companion to turn around, then steal the worker's jacket.</p>

        <p>Head out of the clothing store to the main plaza in Stray, where a robot wearing a black hat is standing in front of the hat store to the right. It won’t let anyone enter as the shop is being restocked, and it could take a while because one worker is missing.</p>

        <p>From that store, enter the bar up ahead that has a big red sign and go to the back to find the missing worker passed out.</p>

        <p>Wake it up by jumping on the shelf above it and dropping the empty bottles on the robot’s head. Now, quickly return to the hat store and hide inside the Stray box in front of the angry worker.</p>

        <p>Once the other one arrives, it will take the box inside the shop, and the Cat can emerge and steal the hat that’s on display, then escape through the small window below. Give the stolen items to Blazer and sneak inside the factory.</p>




        <h1>How To Get The Cassette Tape In Stray</h1>

        <p>The Cassette Tape is obtained after completing a quest for a robot near Clementine’s apartment. Get out through the window of the apartment, head to the first floor where three robots are hanging out, and talk to the one sitting down, Simon. It will ask the Stray Cat and B-12 to disable three cameras in exchange for a Cassette Tape.</p>

        <p>First, head to the second floor and climb the railing of the balcony that overlooks the three robots. Jump on the outdoor compressor and deactivate the first camera (one robot is waving to it).</p>

        <p>Next, head to the other side of the balcony and drop to the sign, which has a camera attached to its end.</p>

        <p>Finally, go to the window left of the second camera (which has potted plants), and jump on its ledge to turn off the third camera.</p>

        <p>After completing these steps, speak with Simon to obtain the Cassette Tape.</p>
