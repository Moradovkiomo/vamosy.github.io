        <p>Finding Clementine in Stray is a very crucial step in saving the Cat from the Dead City that’s full of Zurks. While in the Antvillage, players will get a clue from one of the Outsiders on where to find Clementine in Midtown. It is said that the cyborg has a plan on how to go to the Outside.</p>


        <p>In a new town filled with unfamiliar companions, the Cat is on a new adventure to look for its last hope to finally reunite with the other furry creatures. Not to mention the scattered Stray Memories that can be collected to help B-12 remember everything.</p>

        <p>After receiving the photo from Zbaltazar in Antvillage, the back of it will have Clementine’s address in Stray.</p>


        <p>Upon reaching Midtown and asking a couple of Companions about the address, it is revealed that the blue symbol is the street name, the green dots are the floor number, and the red dots are the room number.</p>

        <p>From the Midtown entrance, walk ahead north until the main plaza appears with its big hologram of a robot. Next, head right to see the blue symbol, showing the street Clementine lives in.</p>

        <p>Proceed forward past three robots, up the stairs to find doors that have red and green dots. The Stray Cat and B-12 must now search for one that matches the address on the photo.</p>

        <p>Go up to the third floor by heading left after climbing the main stairs, then right to climb another one. Upon finding a robot, take a right to the second door that has three green dots and five red ones.</p>

        <p>It is blocked by police tapes, and the window is covered in planks except for a small hole. Jump through the window and get out of the kitchen to meet Clementine.</p>

        <p>Upon being found by the Cat and B-12, Clementine reveals that they have the keys that’ll start the vehicle in the subway station. However, because it’s old, keys alone won’t do the trick, so the cyborg has an idea of how to activate it. The plan revolves around infiltrating Neco Corp Factory, stealing the Atomic Battery in Stray, and powering up the station.</p>

        <p>Players must now search for a friend, Blazer, to sneak inside the factory and grab the battery. Upon finishing that part of the quest, the Cat returns to Clementine only to find the apartment empty, and the only lead is a coded message about the cyborg’s next location.</p>

        <p>This will start the last part of chapter 10, which is finding Clementine in the Nightclub. Other than that, make sure to claim some Stray Trophies in the area before searching for the robot, as there won’t be a second chance to enter the Nightclub.</p>
