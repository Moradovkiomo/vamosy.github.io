        <h1>Stray: Chapter 3 Door Code</h1>

        <p>Before players can complete Chapter 3 of Stray, they'll first need to unlock a door by using a special four-digit code that's hidden in a nearby room.</p>

        <p>After turning on the big computer and activating the B-12 companion drone, Stray players will finally be able to leave the scientist's flat. Before they can venture back outside into the desolate remains of the Dead City, however, they'll first need to navigate a dark and dingy corridor, at the end of which they'll find another locked door that they'll need to get open.</p>


        <p>Sadly, the key from the scientist's secret lab won't work this time around, with players instead needing to input a special four-digit code into the nearby keypad in order to open the door. Thankfully, like many of the puzzles in Stray, finding this code is relatively straightforward, though players will need to make use of B-12's Torchlight functionality in order to do so.</p>




        <h1>What is the Door Code in Chapter 3 of Stray?</h1>

        <p>For players who just want to get on with the main story of Stray as quickly as possible, the Chapter 3 door code is 3748. Players can find this out for themselves fairly easily though, as it's scrawled across a painting in the room on the right side of the corridor. After activating Torchlight by pressing left on the D-Pad, players should head into this room and hop onto the shelves to their left.</p>

        <p>Here, players will find a can of blue paint which can be knocked to the ground by pressing the Triangle button. Doing so will reveal the four-digit door code, which has been painted onto the large framed picture in bright red paint. From there, it's a simple case of heading back to the locked door, pressing the Square button to interact with the Digicode keypad, and then typing in 3748.</p>



        <h1>How to Get to the Slums</h1>

        <p>Upon unlocking the door, players will be able to head back outside by pressing the Triangle button to squeeze through the gap. They'll then need to hop into the nearby bucket, which will carry them over a Zurk-infested part of the city. Soon after, players will come to a painting of a beach which will remind B-12 of the wide open world outside, and then another bucket that leads down to the Safezone.</p>

        <p>As they get out of this second bucket, players will find themselves being chased by Zurks and so will need to quickly hop through the gap in front of them in order to escape. If they keep following the path ahead of them, they'll soon come to a robot mopping the floor, though it's not exactly thrilled to see an adorable little cat entering the slums. This will lead to a conversation with the slums' guardian, after which, players will be able to freely explore the area and can begin tracking down its many memories and hidden pieces of sheet music.</p>
