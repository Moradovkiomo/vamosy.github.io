        <h1>UltraFlix On Android</h1>



        <p>UltraFlix, available across a reasonably wide selection of devices. Thereâ€™s an Android app, but more usefully for people wanting to experience the full extent of its 4K focus, the app is also available via built-in apps on a variety of 4K UHD smart TVs from Sony, Samsung, Hisense, and Vizio. </p>



        <p>Nanotech also offers an external solution, enabling UltraFlix playback on any brand of Ultra HD TV, in the form of the $299 NanoTech Nuvola NP-1 Player.</p>



        <p>UltraFlix also recently added support for High Dynamic Range streaming to select titles.</p>
