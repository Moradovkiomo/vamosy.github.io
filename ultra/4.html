        <h1>Broadband Speed</h1>



        <p>One of the most eye-catching technical claims of the UltraFlix platform is its ability to stream 4K over broadband speeds of just 4Mbps. This compares with a minimum 15Mbps requirement of the Netflix and Amazon 4K streaming services and potentially brings 4K within the grasp of people who don’t have fiber broadband connections. Though inevitably any attempt to deliver a 4K source over such a narrow broadband pipe will be dependent on heavy amounts of compression unlikely to deliver such satisfying results as a faster 4K stream.</p>



        <p>UltraFlix also uniquely offers a 100Mbps streaming option for people with the fastest broadband connections, delivering a level of picture quality which UltraFlix claims is comparable with the images you’ll get from the Ultra HD Blu-ray format.</p>
