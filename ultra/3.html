        <h1>Cost of UltraFlix</h1>



        <p>Unlike Netflix and Amazon, UltraFlix doesn’t currently run a subscription service (though it hasn’t ruled this out as a future possibility). Instead, you pay for each title on either a rental or purchase basis. The exact amount you pay for each film depends on the recency of the content, and potentially the ‘grade’ of the 4K video transfer being used, with rental prices ranging from $2 to $10 for rental periods of 48 hours.</p>



        <p>The 4K grades used are Silver (where a 4K transfer has been achieved by upgrading an original HD transfer), Gold (where 4K versions have been derived from old titles originally shot on film) and Platinum, where the content was originally made in actual 4K.</p>
