        <h1>The Streaming Catalog</h1>

        <p>Right now it must be said that UltraFlix’s content is dominated by relatively old and niche-interest material. However, it caused a stir recently by securing the rights to stream blockbuster hit Interstellar first in 4K UHD, and it recently backed up this initial deal with Paramount with a much larger one that gives it the rights to nearly 1,000 of the studio’s film library.</p>



        <p>Among its other 4K highlights right now are Rain Man, Fargo, The Good, The Bad And The Ugly, Rocky, and Robocop, as well as a host of concert videos and 40 IMAX titles.</p>

        

        <p>The list of high profile 4K titles is growing steadily, with UltraFlix even going so far as owning a 4K post-production studio so that it can convert older films to 4K in return for a window of streaming rights exclusivity.</p>
